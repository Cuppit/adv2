WEAPON ATTACK PROCEDURE

-spawn weapon object
-transform such that it's tail-end touches the edge of the player sprite (from a design perspective, we'll constrain the player sprite to be always a certain size for now)
-Rotate the weapon based on the position of the mouse cursor
-perform swing animation (could be tricky using the animation node if the animation depends on position
