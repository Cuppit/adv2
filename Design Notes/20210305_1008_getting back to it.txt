20210305_1008: getting back to it

Different pressures required more immediate attention, so now here we go.

Last time we left off we wanted to design a simple behavior for an enemy.  

BEHAVIOR DRAFT:  
	-Check if player is in aggro radius
		if yes, continually move towards player
		if no, -wander in random directions

CHECKING IF PLAYER IS IN AGGRO RADIUS
	-Create area2d to represent "aggro radius"
	-Emit a signal in response to a player character entering the radius
	-"acquire" the player as a "target"
		-Continually move towards the player character until the player character leaves the radius

	-when a player character LEAVES the radius...
		-...if that player character was the current target...
		-...set a timer for "stop chasing".
			-Once the "stop chasing" timer expires, resume normal patrol patterns.


Work is cut out, tim efor a break.
