20210218_0904:  More breakthroughs yesterday thanks to Godot community help.  Now I have to sit back and figure out what the next steps are.

RECOLLECTION OF GOAL: Create a basic top-down hack-n-slash, with mechanics in the spirit of Diablo/Hotline Miami.

COMPONENTS CREATED: 

-Character rotates to face mouse
-Attack animation created

COMPONENTS STILL NEEDED

-Enemy characters
-Enemy attack 
-enemy attack effects
-player attack effects
